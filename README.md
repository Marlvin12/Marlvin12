I'm a passionate programmer, always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with fellow developers. My current interests include Machine Learning 🤖 and iOS Development 📱.

Proficient in:

- Python 🐍
- C++ ⚙️
- Swift 🦉
- JavaScript ⚡
- TypeScript 📘

I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration and the amazing outcomes that arise from working together with others in the development community. That's why I love using GitHub as my platform for sharing projects and contributing to open-source initiatives. My goal is to keep growing as a programmer, learning from others, and giving back to the community. Let's code together! 💻
